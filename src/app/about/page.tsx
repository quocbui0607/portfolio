      <p className="mt-6 text-white sm:text-2xl">
        My passion on computer began since I was 7 years old, from playing games
        like: MU Online, Boom Online, Cabal Online,... Although interacting with
        computers at the early lifetime, I decided to take Biotechnology
        Bachelor in University of Sciences, Vietnam.

      <p className="mt-6 text-white sm:text-2xl">
        After 4 years to get Biotechnology Bachelor, I got a job as Purchasing
        Staff at Japanese company. During this time, I decided to follow my
        passionate in Information Technology by taking online course and went to
        IT-center to get knowledge in this time.

      <p className="mt-6 text-white sm:text-2xl">
        Then in 2019, I got the first fresher opportunity as Frontend Engineer
        at Tada Education and FPT Software more than 2 years. After that, I got
        another chance as Fullstack Developer in{" "}
        <span className="text-cyan-300">National Australia Bank Group Limited</span> in 2022,
        from this time, I learned a lot from international banking cooperate
        (way of work, sharing knowledge, change technologies,...)
      </p>

      <p className="mt-6 text-white sm:text-2xl">
        And the last position before I moved to United States that was Golang
        Developer in{" "}
        <span className="text-cyan-300">
          Australia and NewZealand Banking Group Limited
